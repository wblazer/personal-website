            <h1>William Blazer</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineering student focused on honing my web development skills. This website mostly mirrors my resume for now, but I plan to add more in the future. 
                If you would like to check out my actual resume you can do so 
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaNLUAot9RM0FBiZinJrmLCZOHpOQybb/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                If you would like to get in touch feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:williamblazer2@gmail.com">email</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not busy with work or school, you can find me reading, playing video games, listening to new albums, or occasionally rock climbing.
                I'm also passionate about esports, animal rights, cooking, and nutrition.
            </p>
